# lark-syntax-highlighting

A Intellj-Plugin that adds support for [lark grammars](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) to the IDE. Should work in all IDEs, but obviously most useful in PyCharm.

## Installation
*NOTE: WIP It is mostly ready for public consumption. If you install it, please be aware that not all features are finished and that there may still be errors. Please tell me about errors and improvement ideas*

To install, you just need to download the .jar file and go in you IDE go to `Settings -> Plugins -> [Gear] -> Install from Disk`, the select the .jar file. (I might forget to keep the `.jar` file up-to-date. I'm sorry :-/)
